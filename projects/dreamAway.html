    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>This short film follows Ellie, a young girl whose fear of the dark transforms into a magical adventure. What begins as a quiet bedtime routine quickly shifts when strange shadows appear in her room. As Ellie's imagination runs wild, a mysterious glowing star emerges from beneath her bed. Instead of frightening her, the star reveals itself to be friendly and playful, guiding Ellie through a dream‑like transformation of her bedroom. Together, they float, explore, and share a gentle moment of connection before drifting to sleep. The film blends light suspense with warmth, focusing on childhood wonder, comfort, and the power of imagination.</p>

      <h3>My Roles</h3>
      <p>I served as the <strong>co-director</strong> of this 4‑person team, helping guide the creative vision, storytelling direction, and overall look and feel of the film.</p>
      <p>I handled all the rigging work for the film, including both character rigs and prop rigs such as the wooden rocking horse.</p>
      <p>In addition to rigging, I developed several production tools to support animation and team collaboration:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Maya Note Tool:</strong> A custom tool that embeds notes directly into Maya files, allowing artists to leave instructions, reminders, and communication cues tied to specific scenes or objects.</li>
        <li><strong>Blendshape Generator Tool:</strong> A script that automatically creates adjustable blendshape meshes along with animatable controllers, enabling animators to quickly sculpt and refine character expressions at any stage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I also contributed simple prop modeling in both Blender and Maya.</p>
      <p>We also had two additional supporting members who assisted with lighting and provided rigging technical support throughout production.</p>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I'm a 3D artist and technical developer specializing in character rigging, pipeline tools, and AI-assisted animation.</p>
      <p>I build systems that make collaboration smoother and creativity more accessible—from Maya scripts that streamline workflows to machine learning models that automate technical tasks. My work lives in the background, enabling other artists to focus on performance and storytelling.</p>
      <p>I'm drawn to problems at the intersection of art and technology, where thoughtful design can transform how people create together.</p>
